        Hello World this is a sample app created by Tarun.
        The app uses basic android views and view groups to describe how presentation techniques
        work on android.
        So far everything works great and I seem to love the android development experience.
        \n\nThis text is placed here to demonstrate the scroll view layout.
        The scroll view can contain a single view or a single view group.
        As of now this is a simple place holder text for the text view that\'s being nested into the
        scroll view.\n\n
        Developing in android using kotlin is a really great experience for me.
        Although I have developed apps using JAVA, it now seems out of date as google doesn\'t seem
        to care about it anymore, the present android app trend is going to be based off Kotlin and
        the best part is I seem to like it a lot.\n\n
        Kotlin borrows a lot of good parts from PYTHON and from JAVA making it the best choice for
        android programming.
        No more NULL_PTR EXCEPTION in the middle of an application or any app crashes.
        I am really trying to make this scroll view bigger and bigger to see the live scroll effect
        in action in android.
        However it\'s a good experience to brush up my typing skills, LOL :)
